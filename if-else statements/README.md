# C Practice Questions - If-Else Statements

This directory contains C programming exercises focused on conditional statements (if-else). These questions help beginners practice decision-making constructs in C programming.

## About

These practice questions focus specifically on if-else conditional statements in C programming. They cover topics such as:
- Conditional logic and boolean expressions
- Modulus operations for divisibility checks
- Mathematical comparisons
- Decision-making based on multiple conditions

## Questions Included

The directory includes 4 practice problems covering various aspects of if-else statements:

1. Check if a number is divisible by both 13 and 14 but not by 15
2. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 7
3. Check if a number is a multiple of 5
4. Check if a number is a perfect square

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory containing the questions

2. Compile any C program using gcc:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c -lm
   ```
   Note: Use the `-lm` flag when compiling programs that use math functions (like problem 30)

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

Working through these problems will help you understand:
- Basic if-else syntax and structure
- Boolean expressions and logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Modulus operator (%) for divisibility checks
- Using math library functions
- Nested conditional statements
- Proper indentation and formatting of conditional blocks

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **Simple if statements**: Basic conditional execution
- **if-else statements**: Two-way decision making
- **Nested conditions**: Multiple levels of decision making
- **Logical operators**: Combining multiple conditions with AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!)
- **Modulus operations**: Checking divisibility and remainders
- **Mathematical functions**: Using sqrt() from math.h library

## Tips for Success

1. Pay attention to operator precedence when combining conditions
2. Remember to link the math library with `-lm` when using math functions
3. Use parentheses to make complex boolean expressions clearer
4. Test your programs with various inputs, including edge cases
