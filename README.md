# C Practice Questions for Beginners

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises that I practiced while learning C. These questions cover fundamental concepts and help beginners get comfortable with basic programming constructs in C.

## About

These practice questions helped me develop a solid foundation in C programming. They cover topics such as:
- Basic input/output operations
- Arithmetic calculations
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Mathematical formulas
- Unit conversions
- Simple algorithms

## Why I Made This Repository

I created this repository as a learning resource for myself and others who are beginning their journey with C programming. When I first started learning C, I found that practicing with concrete examples was essential for understanding the language fundamentals. Rather than just reading theory, I wanted to write actual code that solves real problems.

This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. **Learning Resource**: It provides a structured set of problems that gradually increase in complexity, allowing beginners to build their skills step-by-step.

2. **Practice Material**: Each problem focuses on specific C programming concepts, offering hands-on experience with different aspects of the language.

3. **Reference Guide**: The solutions serve as examples of how to implement common programming tasks in C, which can be referenced when tackling more complex projects.

4. **Portfolio of Learning**: It documents my journey of learning C programming, showing how I progressed from basic programs to more complex conditional logic.

5. **Community Contribution**: I hope that other beginners will find this repository useful and contribute their own solutions or improvements.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on programming concepts:

- **Basic Question/**: Contains fundamental C programs covering variables, arithmetic operations, input/output, and basic calculations
- **if-else statements/**: Programs focusing on conditional statements and decision-making logic

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-practice-questions-for-beginners.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the questions you want to practice

3. Compile any C program using gcc:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c -lm
   ```
   Note: Use the `-lm` flag when compiling programs that use math functions

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
