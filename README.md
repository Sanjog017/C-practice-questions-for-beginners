# C Programming Practice Questions

Welcome to the C Programming Practice Questions repository! This collection contains various C programming exercises organized by topic to help beginners learn and practice C programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different categories based on programming concepts:

- [**Basics**](./basics/README.md): Fundamental C programs covering variables, operators, input/output, and basic calculations
- [**Loops**](./loops/README.md): Programs demonstrating different types of loops (for, while, do-while) and their applications
- [**Conditionals**](./conditionals/README.md): Programs using if-else statements and switch cases for decision making
- [**Functions**](./functions/README.md): Examples of function definitions, calls, and parameter passing
- [**Arrays**](./arrays/README.md): Working with arrays and multidimensional arrays
- [**Pointers**](./pointers/README.md): Understanding pointers and pointer arithmetic
- [**Strings**](./strings/README.md): String manipulation and operations
- [**Structures**](./structures/README.md): Using structures to group related data
- [**File Handling**](./file-handling/README.md): Reading from and writing to files

## How to Use

Each section contains:
- Sample problems with solutions
- Explanatory comments in the code
- Progressive difficulty levels

Start with the [Basics](./basics/README.md) section if you're new to C programming, then gradually move to more advanced topics.

Happy Coding!
