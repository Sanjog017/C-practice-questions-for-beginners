- Basic input/output operations
- Arithmetic calculations
- Conditional statements
- Mathematical formulas
- Unit conversions
- Simple algorithms

## Questions Included

The repository includes 29 practice problems covering various aspects of C programming:

1. Calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle
2. Calculate simple interest and total amount
3. Calculate volume and surface area of a room
4. Calculate area and painting cost of four walls
5. Calculate area and perimeter of a circle
6. Calculate sum, difference, product, and average of two numbers
7. Calculate cube of a given number
8. Find square root of a number
9. Calculate sum of cubes of two numbers

27. Check if a number is divisible by 3 and 7
28. Check if a number is a multiple of 5

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-practice-questions-for-beginners.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the questions

3. Compile any C program using gcc:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Learning Outcomes
